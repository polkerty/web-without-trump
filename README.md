# Web Without Trump
This user script blacks out text content that references Trump and related topics. It is privacy-friendly and works with even the crankiest sorts of javascript frameworks.

To use, you'll first need to install TamperMonkey for [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en](Chrome) (for Chrome) or [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/](FireFox) or the equivalent for your browser of choise. 

Then you can just [install the userscript](https://github.com/polkerty/web-without-trump/blob/main/src/web-without-trump.user.js). You can also customize the script after installation if you'd like.

# FAQ
## What words are on the blacklist, and can I customize them?
The list may be prone to change, but you can see the list [here](https://github.com/polkerty/web-without-trump/blob/main/src/web-without-trump.user.js#L17) and edit it too from your TamperMonkey dashboard, if you'd like. 

## Hasn't this been done before?
There are alternatives like the [Trump Filter](https://trumpfilter.com/), but that extension tracks you and isn't easy to customize/extend.
